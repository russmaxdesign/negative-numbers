# Negative Numbers and VoiceOver

In default mode OSX VoiceOver ignores some symbols such as the dash symbol ("-"). This can cause issues when presenting information such as negative numbers as the "negative" aspect of the number is ignored.

If this is a concern for individuals, they can change their individual verbosity settings and set punctuation to "all".

But what if you want to make sure negative numbers are announced accurately for all VoiceOver users, regardless of their verbosity settings?
